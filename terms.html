                Subscription fees are billed in advance on either a monthly or
                annual basis depending on the billing cycle selected during
                registration. All fees are non-refundable unless otherwise

                If you choose to upgrade or downgrade your subscription plan,
                the changes will take effect immediately for upgrades (with
                prorated charges) and at the end of the current billing cycle
                for downgrades.
              </p>
              <p>
                We may change our fees at any time by providing at least 30
                days' advance notice. By continuing to use the Service after a
                price change takes effect, you agree to pay the updated fees.
              </p>
              <p>
                If payment is not received by the due date, we may suspend your
